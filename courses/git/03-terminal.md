abstract:
  You are going to be doing a lot of work in the terminal.
  In this chapter we cover how to get started with your terminal, navigate directory structures and execute popular commands.
---

A command line interface tool let's you _talk_ to your computer by interacting with
various commands and utilities from the terminal. This is where you will start to work with Git.

:white_check_mark: The default Bash Terminal will be sufficient if you are using a Mac or Linux machine.\
I use [iTerm2][iterm] which is a replacement for the Terminal.

:white_check_mark: You should use the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** available [here][wsl]
or the Git Bash terminal that is installed with Git.

> In the next chapter we will look at the GUI but I strongly suggest getting comfortable using the terminal
> as it is faster, you get a better understanding of how Git works and your skill proficiency will
> increase which is desirable to have in your career.

## Introduction to Vim

Vim is a highly configurable text editor that you can use for software development
or any kind of text editing. In this course you will learn how to use and exit :joy: Vim.

Vim can be installed anywhere and is preinstalled on many machines including Linux servers.
If you connect to them remotely, you may need to have basic Vim skills to
interact with the editor. It's also a quick and offers a pneumonic way of committing messages
to Git. That sentence will make more sense if you get into the swing of things.
