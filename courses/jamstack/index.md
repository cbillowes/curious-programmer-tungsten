## Objectives

At the end of this course you would have created a primitive todo React app which
integrates with a DataStax Astra DB via Netlify serverless functions and was made pretty with Tailwind CSS.

> This course is a spin-off using the DataStax example [todo-astra-jamstack-netlify][example].
> We will create this project from scratch. You may access or reference the official course [repository][todo-repo] at any time.
> [This][final-product] is the final product that you can use to reference. :clap:

## :raised_hand: Errata/amendments

**Note:** I try to delivery quality material but being human falls through the cracks so
feel free to make amendments to the course by either commenting in the comments
on each page to notify me of any issues you pick up
or simply create a [Pull Request][pr] on GitHub.
