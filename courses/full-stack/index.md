abstract:
  In this course you will build a review app using React and Tailwind CSS.
  It will have rating and commenting features.
  You will connect to a MongoDB instance, use Firebase Authentication and
  host your app on AppEngine on the Google Cloud Platform
  (hosting options requires billing to be enabled).

At the end of this course you would have created a web application that can list things,
in this case companies. Authenticated users can rate these companies by clicking on stars and
they can comment on them.

Feel free to practice by adding features or changing existing
features to and in this project.

## Objectives

1. Be able to create a simple and pretty full-stack production
   web application with React and Tailwind CSS.
1. Know how to connect to a local and remote instance of MongoDB.
1. Know how to register and sign in users using Firebase Authentication.
1. Know how to host the web application on AppEngine on Google Cloud Platform
   (hosting options requires billing to be enabled).

## Assumptions

You are able to code, have a good understanding of JavaScript,
are comfortable with Git, React and Node.js,
are familiar with REST and MongoDB,
and have hopefully heard of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Google Firebase Authentication.
