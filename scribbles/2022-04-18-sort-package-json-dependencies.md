```bash
npm r -S example; npm r -D example
```

is short hand for `npm remove --save anything` and `npm remove --save-dev whatever`.

"example" is just the name of a package. You can use it verbatim because it will most likely not be in your package.json. Your packages are sorted by running npm remove even if the package "example" doesn't exist.
