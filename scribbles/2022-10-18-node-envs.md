Running a Node app is simple.

```bash:title=bash
node panic.js
```

Sometimes you want to add environment variables that either contain sensitive information
or are contextual to the environment you want to run your app on.
You can set them the moment the process is started.

```bash:title=bash
NUMBER=42 ANIMAL=dolphins PREFIX=don\'t node panic.js
```

Imagine having to do this approach with multiple vars and for production ready systems where commands
are written to the logs. Not a good idea. This approach is great for testing though.

To access these variables in your code, simply prefix the scream case with `process.env.`.

```js:title=panic.js
console.log(`${process.env.NUMBER} is my favorite number.`);
console.log(`${process.env.ANIMAL} are my favourite animals`);
console.log(`${process.env.PREFIX} panic!`);
```

What you do then is create a hidden environment file in the root of your project most commonly named `.env`.

```txt:file=.env
NUMBER="42"
ANIMAL="dolphins"
PREFIX="don't"
```

If you have multiple environments, you can use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
to load them during runtime.

```js:title=panic.js
require('dotenv').config();

console.log(`${process.env.NUMBER} is my favorite number.`);
console.log(`${process.env.ANIMAL} are my favourite animals`);
console.log(`${process.env.PREFIX} panic!`);
```

> ### Note
>
> You don't need to import the `dotenv` Node package into your codebase.
> Instead run the command below to run the code and do a module to preload (option can be repeated)
> to **require** the dependency(ies).

```bash:title=bash
node --require dotenv/config panic.js
# or shortened to
node -r dotenv/config panic.js
```

If you have multiple files for different environments then you can specify the
file by appending `dotenv_config_path` to it.

```bash:title=bash
node -r dotenv/config panic.js dotenv_config_path=.env-vogsphere
```

Append `dotenv_config_debug=true` to the command to print out the values in the file.
