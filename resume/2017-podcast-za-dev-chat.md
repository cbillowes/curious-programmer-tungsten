[Listen](https://zadevchat.io/67/) to the episode where I talk about imposter syndrome,
what it is and how to overcome it. Join us as we learn about this and other issues around the often overlooked topics of mental well-being.

Inspired by Scott Hanselman's "I'm a phony. Are you?" post, I blogged about my own experiences with feeling like an imposter. This well written post landed her interviews on two other podcasts, ours, and the Reddit front page. I later presented at Rubyfuza 2017 and a recent Jozi.rb.

This post and other well researched posts focuses a lot on how important mental health & well-being is and shares a lot things we can do to look after ourselves.
