I was based at DStv Digital Media the day I joined 3Fifteen (now Britehouse). I was introduced to Agile and formed part of a Scrum environment in a cross-functional team.

The first team I joined was the Original Productions team. I worked on projects:

- Idols South Africa
- Big Brother Mzansi and Big Brother Angola
- Channel O Music Video Awards
- Africa Magic Viewers' Choice Awards (AMVCA)

I was later moved to the DStv Now website, an online DStv live TV and Catch Up streaming service for selected subscription packages.

## Channel O Africa Music Video Awards

The Annual Channel O Africa Music Awards is the leading and most consistently exciting music awards event on the continent.

We built the website displaying all music video submissions allowing users to vote for their favorites.

## Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards (AMVCA)

The AMVCAs were created to celebrate the contribution of African filmmakers, actors and technicians in the success of the continent's film and television industry.

We built the website displaying all movie and individual submissions allowing users to vote for their favorites.

## Idols South Africa Website

With Idols, contestants could be voted to the next round using voting mechanisms like the website, SMS, USSD, WeChat and the mobile website. These mechanisms were processed using our internal voting engine. High volume votes were consolidated and audited to ensure validity for announcements.

## Big Brother websites

With Big Brother, housemates would be eliminated using voting mechanisms like the website, SMS, USSD, WeChat and the mobile website. These mechanisms were processed using our internal voting engine.

Viewers could watch online video streaming. Free videos and articles were curated by content editors. VIP, a paid for service, let viewers watch live uncut video streams on the website.

SMSs aired on Live TV were displayed on the MSG2TV page.
