# Description

Hand-rolling each project took a lot of development effort. Streamlined the process by introducing a portal to build fully customizable, multi-tenancy Bootcamps for event registrations geared for Microsoft but generic enough to be used by other vendors.

- Cut development effort by 70% per project by architecting and implementing a multi-tenant Bootcamp registration portal, replacing hand-rolled event builds.

- Boosted partner visibility and attendee engagement through a branded Bootcamp listing page, enabling companies to showcase offerings and attract sign-ups.

- Improved attendee experience by engineering a secure, streamlined registration process that reduced friction and administrative overhead.

- Increased operational efficiency with a comprehensive management portal, leading to a 20% drop in support tickets and faster response times.
