---

I was responsible for the development of custom event registration and management solutions.
My primary focus was on Microsoft events such as Tech-Ed (Africa and Middle East),
Partner Summit, Bootcamps, DevDays and TechDays. In 2010, I was promoted to Team Lead.

In most Tech-Ed and Partner Summit I would design & develop registration websites & supporting tools.
(A full support tool for support centre staff was created as a Windows application by a different developer who I worked closely with)

The registration portion included:

- registration form for delegate, speaker, sponsor, Microsoft staff
- allow support staff to apply discount
- online payment using (Nedbank iVeri Lite or Mashreq)
- a session scheduler with a built in evaluation form
- an agenda
- design competition images to be displayed on the isle TVs during the event

Onsite I would:

- ensure that rotating content displays correctly on the isle screens (competitions, agenda etc)
- display top speakers and top talks in the speaker room
- setup onsite website on onsite machines for easy self-help
- aid support staff with any delegate queries
- support speakers regarding their evaluation queries
- provide client-facing support where needed

For Bootcamps, DevDays and TechDays the registration website was built with a full support system in the back-end.

My colleague and I worked closely with the Support Centre personnel.

## Microsoft Events

### Microsoft Tech-Ed Middle East

Design and develop the Microsoft Tech-Ed Middle East websites for 2010 and 2011. We traveled to Dubai to provide on site support which was a real treat but a lot of hard work.

I learned the importance of saving time in UTC and testing a product on a slow connection to ensure the performance of the solution is taken into account and is optimized.

### Microsoft Tech-Ed 2011 Directory

Speakers and Attendees who have opted in would be displayed here to assist with networking prior to the event. The filters to the right helped users to filter out and get to delegates who were truly matched to them.
