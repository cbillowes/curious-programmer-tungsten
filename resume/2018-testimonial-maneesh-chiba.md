I worked with Clarice during my time at DStv Digital Media
across two scrum teams. Clarice has an exceptional knowledge and experience
with real world implementations across various web,app and software solutions.

She is constantly refining her skills which results in code that is not only well
written, but also compliant with industry standards as well the those of the project
team or company. She is unfliching in exploring outside of her defined realms and questions
intelligently which makes her a huge asset on any team.

In addition to her excellent software development skills, Clarice is a real team player,
highly efficient and an all round pleasure to be around. I would personally jump at the
opportunity to work with her again and highly recommend her to anyone.
