Clarice is a thinking developer, she is able to take the lead and follow as needed,
and this ability makes her a valuable asset in any team.

I was the Scrum Master and we worked together on the DStv Now project. S
he was the developer always looking for the ways to integrate the best innovation and technical
solutions while ensuring itâ€™s still customer centric. Clarice was always looking for ways
of increasing agility in our delivery and ensuring quality is built into the product.

As a colleague Clarice is always striving to create mindfulness in her work and also in her relationships.
I am happy with the work she did as part of the DStv Now project and give her my full recommendation.
