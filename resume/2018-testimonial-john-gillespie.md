I have had the distinct pleasure of working alongside Clarice for a number of years now.
During this time I have come to know her as an upstanding individual, and an invaluable member of the team.

Clarice always strives to perform tasks to the best of her abilities, often going
far beyond what the original expectation was in an effort to permanently solve any
problems she might uncover. A competent developer, she is able to take initiative
when the situation calls for it but also knows when to stand back and ask for
direction from other sources.

Clarice is extremely knowledgeable, and shows an eagerness to learn and grow in new fields
as well as in her current field of expertise. I believe Clarice is an asset to any organization she works for.
