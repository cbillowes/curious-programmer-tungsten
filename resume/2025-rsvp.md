# Description

I designed and built a centralized event registration platform with Next.js, integrating Firebase for secure authentication and data management. By implementing a user-friendly Shadcn and TailwindCSS interface, I streamlined RSVP handling, reduced errors, and delivered a seamless guest experience.

Streamlined guest management by designing and building a centralized registration system with Next.js, reducing manual RSVP tracking and errors.

Enhanced user experience through a modern, intuitive interface built with Shadcn UI and TailwindCSS, increasing guest engagement and response rates.

Ensured secure and reliable data handling by integrating Firebase authentication and data management, reinforcing trust and safeguarding attendee information.
