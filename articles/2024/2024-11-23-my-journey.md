abstract: I went from a .NET comfort zone to Clojureâ€™s minimalist world, embracing challenges and growth. It was humbling yet rewardingâ€”proof that change leads to incredible opportunities.

## TL;DR

I started as a .NET developer, comfortable in my familiar bubble. But when my friend Len introduced me to Clojure, I decided to take a leap into an unfamiliar worldâ€”right around the time I was passed over for a promotion. It was challenging, humbling, and thrilling. I went from managing infrastructure at CloudAfrica to working in insuretech with Simply Financial Services, eventually moving to Mauritius.

Learning Clojure felt like transitioning from technical manuals to crafting poetry. It hasnâ€™t been easy, but embracing its simplicity and the supportive community has been deeply rewarding. My advice? Donâ€™t fear feeling like a beginner againâ€”embrace the journey, celebrate your wins, and keep learning. The rewards are worth it.

I started my journey as a Microsoft .NET developer, deeply immersed in web technologies. I loved the curly braces, semi-colons, Intellisense, the Visual Studio IDE, the .NET framework, ReSharper, SQL Serverâ€”you name it. I was comfortable in my cozy bubble. Life was good, and I never imagined leaving the comfort of what I knew. There was really no reason for me to leave.

Then my awesome friend [Len Weincier](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/lenweincier), now an Engineering Manager at Google in Ireland, introduced me to [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). At the time, I was a senior developer at MultiChoice, and Clojure wasnâ€™t exactly a household name in South Africa. Would this be career suicide? The leap from .NET to an obscure Lisp seemed terrifying.

It was around the same time I was passed over for a promotion so I decided to entertain the idea. Len and I met at a trampoline park, and while his daughter bounced around, he taught me the basics of Clojureâ€”right there on a napkin. Yes, Clojure is that simple to grasp! With a small core language, just a handful of constructs, and a powerful, simple standard library, Clojure lets you focus on solving problems instead of wrestling with language complexity. By contrast, .NET has a feature-rich ecosystem, high-level abstractions, and often requires more code to accomplish even basic tasks. Thereâ€™s nothing inherently wrong with that, of courseâ€”itâ€™s just not quite as napkin-friendly.

That informal learning session did something to me. It piqued my curiosity. Maybe a change was, in fact, as good as a holiday. So I took the leapâ€”as intimidating as it was.

## The Ramp Up

Iâ€™ll always have a soft spot for C# and .NET, but switching to Clojure turned out to be the best career move Iâ€™ve ever made. The start was rockyâ€”I went from being an experienced developer to feeling like a complete novice. One of my early challenges was understanding how to navigate Linux. I was used to the comfort of Visual Studio, and suddenly I had to work with the command line and IntelliJ, which felt completely alien at first. I felt like I had lost all my skills. I struggled to build a simple webpage albeit I was trying out ClojureScript. Most days, I felt like I was climbing Everest with no guide. I had to let go of everything Microsoft: the comfort of Visual Studio, the familiarity of C#. Suddenly, I was facing GitLab, Linux, the terminal, cloud services, CISCO, the JVM, Datomic, Clojure(Script) and so forth.

It was humbling, and it was thrilling. Every day, I learned something new. The climb was steep, but the view was spectacular.

## From VMs to Insurance

At [CloudAfrica](https://www.cloudafrica.net/), I started by getting my hands dirty at a low level: programmatic server backups, firewall rules, networking configurations, breaking and restoring NATs on CISCO, migrating VMs, and creating data visibility with Prometheus and Grafana. While it was stimulating, the constant pressure started to wear me down. You know that icy feeling in the pit of your stomach when something goes wrong? Itâ€™s way worse when youâ€™re tinkering with clientsâ€™ virtual machines.

When [Pieter Koornhof](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieterkoornhof/) mentioned that [Simply Financial Services](https://simply.co.za/) was looking for Clojure developers, I figuredâ€”why not give insuretech a shot? After spending time managing infrastructure and dealing with low-level configurations, I found the idea of building products and working in a more customer-focused industry appealing. It wasnâ€™t like I woke up dreaming about working in insurance, but I felt that I needed to go back to web-heavy products. I ended up working with some big names in the industry, and just three months later, I was asked if Iâ€™d like to move to Mauritius to help with [Cloudsure](https://cloudsure.mu). Erm, obvs!

## Starting Overâ€”Again

Joining a new company meant a fresh start, complete with a whole new set of challengesâ€”learning the life insurance domain, getting used to new tools like Mac, Emacs, GCP, and diving deeper into distributed architecture.

Five years later, the fascination still hasnâ€™t faded. Reflecting on the journey, I realize that embracing change and the unknown has kept me engaged and continuously learning. One of the biggest draws of Clojure has been its emphasis on simplicityâ€”taking the complex and making it beautifully functional. Whether Iâ€™m dealing with a new product launch, a data migration, or optimizing a distributed system, Clojure helps keep me engaged and curious.

## Learning and Adapting

Recently, we launched new products after migrating underwriters for Simply Financial Services. Navigating that codebase was a bit like tumbling down the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderlandâ€”some parts were mind-bogglingly frustrating, while others were sheer brilliance. It was also phenomenal to see junior developers quickly adapt and thrive.

Taking the leap into Clojure has been one of the most rewarding decisions of my career. It hasnâ€™t always been easy, and Iâ€™m not here to tell you that Clojure is some kind of holy grail. But Iâ€™ve learned to appreciate functional simplicity, especially during those moments when co-pilotâ€™s suggestions lead me astray, or when Iâ€™m in the middle of a chaotic merge conflict.

Learning Clojure felt like transitioning from writing dry technical manuals to crafting poetry. As for the brackets, they were like navigating a bewildering jungle gym. Now, armed with Paredit, Iâ€™m the proud gatekeeper of my parentheses. And REPL-driven development? It completely won me overâ€”my trusty sidekick ever since.

## The Importance of Community

The Clojure community has been one of the most rewarding aspects of this journey. From LinkedIn to Reddit and the Clojurian Slack, thereâ€™s always help around. Iâ€™ve even received DMs from icons like Danie Roux, Stuart Halloway, Bozhidar Batsov, Robert Stuttaford, and Dmitri Sotnikov. Itâ€™s humbling and encouraging to know that youâ€™re not alone.

One particularly challenging time was when our Figwheel REPL refused to start with a cryptic "fat file, but missing compatible architecture" error. This issue was crucial because it blocked our development progress, and solving it taught me the importance of community resources and persistence in tackling obscure problems. I searched high and low until I stumbled upon an answer in the Clojurian Slack archives. It saved me, and you can check it out [here](https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/CALJ3BFLP/p1683719686069639?thread_ts=1683719055.164609&cid=CALJ3BFLP).

## Taking the Leap

Should you take the leap? Itâ€™s up to you :smile: Clojure is a fantastic choice to dabble in.
If youâ€™re considering it, hereâ€™s my advice: donâ€™t be afraid to feel like a beginner again. Itâ€™s okay to stumble, to get lost in the brackets, to question your sanity. Embrace the learning curveâ€”itâ€™s worth it, and the community is there to help. Also:

- Be patient with yourself
- Celebrate all of your wins
- Keep a journal of your progress and what you learn
- Practice on a daily basis
- Embrace the REPL
- Donâ€™t be afraid to ask for help
- Find a mentor to guide you
