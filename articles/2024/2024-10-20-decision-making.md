## TL;DR

Decision making is a team effort that works best when it’s clear, collaborative, and intentional. By asking the right questions and seeking diverse perspectives, teams can unlock better solutions and avoid decision boomeranging (constantly revisiting decisions). Collaboration requires structure, trust, and open communication, while the DRIP framework (decision, recommendation, intention, and plan) ensures everyone is on the same page. Taking initiative at the right decision level—whether solo, collaborative, or managerial—leads to smoother outcomes and greater team maturity.

**Based on my previous recent articles, it’s evident that I’m still working my way through _Team Habits_ by Charlie Gilkey. And let me tell you—it’s pure gold. Today, I’m diving into the delightful chaos that is decision making.**

You know that feeling when you’re standing at a crossroads, unsure which way to go? It’s like staring at a restaurant menu and wondering, "Should I stick with the usual, or risk something adventurous and regret it later?" Now imagine doing that, but with your entire team watching, and everyone’s asking, “So, what’s the plan?” That’s what team decision making feels like sometimes. But here’s the thing—are we even approaching these decisions the right way? Is there a "right way"? And if there is, why does it sometimes feel like we’re throwing darts blindfolded and hoping for a bullseye?

It’s tricky enough being one person trying to make a choice; imagine adding an entire team to the mix. If roles are unclear and no one steps up, you’ve got a recipe for stagnation. Who should take responsibility for what? And what does taking responsibility actually mean? Here’s a thought: taking responsibility doesn’t mean having all the answers; it means owning the questions. And asking the right ones until everyone’s on the same page. Sometimes it’s less about solving the problem and more about figuring out what the real problem is.

## Ask effective questions

So maybe the key to good decisions is knowing which questions to ask in the first place. Funny, isn’t it? We spend so much time agonizing over decisions, we forget to ask, “Wait, what are we actually trying to solve here?” Of course, asking the right questions isn’t exactly a walk in the park either. What’s the secret sauce?

Asking an effective question is like navigating a maze—but you’re not looking for the quickest way out. You’re hunting for hidden doors that lead to unexpected places. **Effective questions are powered by curiosity and backed by intention.** They aren’t just about finding answers; they’re about exploring possibilities, challenging assumptions, and rethinking the problem entirely. They’re the key to unlocking new perspectives and improving decision making.

Picture being stuck in traffic with no obvious way forward. Most people will ask, “How do I get out of this?” Fair enough, but that only solves the immediate issue. A more interesting question might be, “Why does this traffic jam even exist?” You’re not getting out of the jam any faster, but now you’re thinking about the bigger picture—systems, behaviors, patterns. Sometimes the best questions are the ones that make you stop and rethink the problem from the ground up.

## Think about the bigger picture

This ties directly into systems thinking, because asking effective questions shifts your focus from isolated problems to understanding the larger system at play. Instead of reacting to a single issue—like patching up one part of a machine—you start to see how that issue fits into a bigger web of causes and effects. Systems thinking encourages us to view everything as interconnected. Just like traffic jams aren’t just about cars, but about urban planning, driver behavior, and public policy, your team’s challenges aren’t in isolation. By asking deeper questions, you move beyond short-term fixes and start crafting long-term solutions that actually work within the whole system.

## Engage and speak up

I’ve also been on teams where questions just didn’t get asked. The introverts stayed quiet, while the extroverts dominated the conversation. It was the same people asking questions, while the rest of the team just nodded along, like spectators at a tennis match where only one player had a racket. As a result, our decisions were rushed, shallow, and often wrong. Too much responsibility fell on the few who were vocal, leaving other valuable perspectives unheard. This begs the question: how do we activate and empower the entire team? What are we missing by not encouraging more voices? How can we improve our decision-making by asking better, deeper questions? And most importantly, what’s the bigger picture we’re not seeing?

## Collaborate with your team

Collaboration is at the heart of effective decision making, transforming individual efforts into collective success. When teams collaborate, they combine unique strengths, perspectives, and expertise, creating a synergy that leads to better decisions and more creative problem-solving. It’s not just about sitting in the same room (or on the same Zoom call); it’s about truly engaging with each other’s ideas, building on them, and being open to feedback—even if it stings a little.

Of course, collaboration isn’t just about good vibes and handshakes. It requires effort and structure. Successful collaboration depends on having clear goals, mutual respect, and the ability to handle differences constructively. While diverse perspectives are a strength, they can also cause friction if not managed well. That’s why teams need processes for communicating, resolving disagreements, and staying aligned. When done right, collaboration leads to stronger decisions, deeper engagement, and—dare I say it—better outcomes for everyone.

## Seek diverse perspectives

Speaking of diverse perspectives, they’re absolutely crucial in decision making. Why? Because they broaden the range of ideas and possibilities on the table. When you bring in people with different backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints, you reduce the risk of blind spots and groupthink. It’s like having multiple pairs of eyes on the problem—you’re more likely to spot things others might miss. Plus, creating a culture where everyone feels comfortable sharing, even if their view is unconventional, opens up the door to more innovative and robust solutions. So, get comfortable with differences. Embrace them. You never know which perspective will unlock the next big breakthrough.

## Take initiative

In _Team Habits_, Charlie Gilkey offers a helpful breakdown of decision-making levels, which can guide teams in understanding who should make decisions and when. At the most basic level, _Level 1 decisions_ are the ones you make solo. These are low-stakes, day-to-day choices that you can own without consulting others—think choosing your lunch or organizing your workspace. Simple, but they set the tone for how you handle responsibility.

_Level 2 decisions_ are a step up. You’re still making the decision, but you’re actively consulting others who share responsibility. It’s like leading a project and getting input from your team or stakeholders before making the final call. _Level 3 decisions_ are the big ones—management’s territory. These strategic choices impact the entire organization and involve higher-level goals and long-term plans. Knowing which level a decision falls under helps ensure the right people are involved, and that decisions are made efficiently without unnecessary rehashing.

Taking initiative means knowing when to act independently and when to bring others into the conversation. Whether it’s a quick Level 1 call or a collaborative Level 2 process, initiative is about stepping up, seeking input when needed, and driving decisions forward—without waiting for someone else to nudge you along.

## Become a mature team

Team maturity starts with building trust and fostering accountability. Trust enables open communication and the ability to take risks, while accountability ensures that everyone follows through on their commitments. Without trust, collaboration is shallow, and decisions are more likely to stagnate. When trust is present, though, teams can engage more deeply and productively, knowing they’ve got each other’s backs.

Mature teams also handle conflict and feedback constructively. Disagreements aren’t seen as threats, but as opportunities for growth. Encouraging open discussions, giving feedback with respect, and being receptive to input fosters an environment where the team can continuously learn and adapt. As the team evolves, regular reflection—through retrospectives, mentorship, or training—helps build stronger habits that push the team’s maturity even further.

## Avoid the decision boomerang

Avoiding decision boomeranging (where decisions keep coming back for re-discussion) boils down to clarity and closure. First, make sure everyone understands the decision-making process and the reasoning behind the final choice. When everyone is clear on why a decision was made and how it fits into the broader goals, they’re less likely to revisit it. Clearly defining who’s responsible for each decision helps too.

Closure is essential. Once a decision is made, the team needs to commit to moving forward unless new, critical information arises. This means voicing concerns during the decision process—not after. And if someone’s holding things up by arguing for the sake of arguing, it might be time to pull in a “referee” to keep things on track. Time is precious, so don’t waste it debating a decision that’s already been made. Move forward and make adjustments later if necessary.

## DRIP Framework

The DRIP framework—_Decision, Recommendation, Intention, and Plan_—is a structured approach to decision making that helps ensure clarity and alignment within a team. Here's how it works:

1. **Decision**: This is the actual choice that’s being made. It’s the final call after considering all options, whether it’s about a strategy, a project, or a specific task. The key is to clearly identify the decision so everyone knows what the goal is.

2. **Recommendation**: This involves offering suggestions or options that can help guide the decision. Team members, stakeholders, or leaders might recommend certain actions based on their expertise, experience, or data. It’s a way to bring ideas to the table before the final decision is made.

3. **Intention**: Here, the team outlines the intention behind the decision—why it’s being made and what the desired outcomes are. Understanding the intention helps ensure that everyone is on the same page about the purpose of the decision and its long-term impact.

4. **Plan**: Once the decision is made, a clear plan is needed to execute it. This includes the steps, responsibilities, and timeline for making the decision a reality. A solid plan ensures that the decision doesn’t just stay theoretical but is put into action effectively.

By following the DRIP framework, teams ensure that decisions are well-thought-out, transparent, and actionable, reducing confusion and helping everyone understand the next steps.

## Conclusion

In the end, decision making must be intentional and structured to ensure clarity and alignment within the team. By following the DRIP framework—decision, recommendation, intention, and plan—teams can eliminate confusion and ensure everyone knows what’s happening and why. When decision making is clear and intent-based, it builds trust, empowers the team, and keeps things moving forward with purpose. Plus, it spares us all from that dreaded decision boomerang.
