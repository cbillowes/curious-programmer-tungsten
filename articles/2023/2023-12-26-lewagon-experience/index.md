On a spontaneous and thrilling whim, I eagerly enrolled in the part-time Data Science boot camp at Le Wagon in Mauritius, commencing on June 24, 2023.
The journey kicked off with a rigorous 30-day prep phase before the official launch of the boot camp.
During this period, I delved into the realms of Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Calculus, subjects that I had never covered in such detail before.

The sheer complexity of these topics left me feeling disoriented and overwhelmed, prompting a wave of panic to set in.
However, I completed a 67-day, 360-hour immersive training experience that would redefine my understanding of data science.

Joining Batch #1287, I quickly found myself amidst a captivating journey that unfolded until its conclusion on December 9, 2023.
I have officially joined the ranks of Le Wagon's alumni, and I take great pride in having been a participant in the Data Science boot camp.

The boot camp proved to be an intensive yet immensely rewarding undertaking, thanks to the unwavering support of my peers, dedicated instructors, teaching assistants, campus staff, family and friends.

## What did I learn?

I gained a profound understanding of the data science ecosystem, adopting essential tools and languages like Python, SQL, and machine learning frameworks.
Beyond technical skills, the program emphasizes problem-solving, fostering a mindset that empowers graduates to navigate the complexities of the ever-evolving data landscape with confidence and innovation.

### Back to Basics

Explore the fundamentals of Git which involves understanding version control and collaborative coding, enabling seamless collaboration and tracking changes in software development.
We delved into the Command Line interface which enhances proficiency in navigating and manipulating files and directories, providing essential skills for efficient code management and system interaction.

Do you know about `tree`, `history` and `grep`? Use `man` to find out more about these commands.

### Programming Languages

As an experienced software engineer, I am already familiar with the fundamentals of programming. I have had exposure to both Python and SQL but never in the context of data science.
It was a fun refresher and a great opportunity to learn new concepts and techniques.

- **Python** is the foundational programming language for data science in the boot camp and is used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization while
- **SQL** is fundamental for working with databases and extracting valuable insights from structured data.
- [Juypter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks are a great way to experiment with code and visualize data quickly and efficiently.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has many extensions that can truly integrate your development experience.

### Statistical Concepts

- **Descriptive statistics** provide a compelling snapshot of data, revealing key insights through measures like mean, median, and standard deviation, allowing us to understand and summarize complex information.
- On the other hand, **inferential statistics** empower us to make predictions and draw meaningful conclusions about a population based on a sample, unlocking the ability to generalize findings and make informed decisions in various fields such as business, healthcare, and social sciences.

### Mathematics for Data Science

- **Linear Algebra** becomes indispensable when comprehending operations in high-dimensional spaces, a foundational concept crucial in machine learning.
- **Calculus**, specifically derivatives and integrals, plays a pivotal role in optimization algorithms, providing the mathematical framework essential for fine-tuning models and enhancing predictive accuracy.

### Machine Learning

- In **supervised** learning, models are trained on labeled data to undertake prediction or classification tasks.
- In **unsupervised** learning, the focus shifts to exploring patterns and relationships within data, even in the absence of labeled outcomes.
- **Model evaluation** is a critical phase, involving the assessment of machine learning models to gauge their performance and ensure their effectiveness in real-world applications.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

- **Pandas** and **NumPy** are Python libraries designed for efficient data manipulation and analysis, providing powerful tools for handling structured data.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** serve as essential tools in Python for crafting visualizations, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of data through the creation of insightful plots and graphics.

### Deep Learning

- **Neural Networks** form the fundamental building blocks of artificial intelligence, encompassing the basics crucial for delving into the realm of deep learning.
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, as frameworks, play pivotal roles in the construction and training of neural networks, providing powerful tools for implementing and optimizing sophisticated machine learning models.

### ML Ops

- **ML Ops** is a set of practices that combines machine learning and DevOps to enhance the efficiency of machine learning workflows, enabling the seamless deployment of models in production environments.
- **Docker** is a containerization platform that facilitates the packaging and deployment of applications, providing a standardized environment for running software in various environments.
- **Streamlit** is a Python library that enables the creation of interactive web apps for data science and machine learning, allowing data scientists to showcase their work and share their findings with the world.

### Soft Skills

- **Communication** skills are honed to effectively convey findings and insights, ensuring a seamless exchange of information within the data science domain.
- **Problem-solving** capabilities are sharpened, fostering critical thinking skills essential for addressing complex challenges inherent in data-related scenarios.
- The **art of presentation** is mastered, equipping individuals with the ability to articulate ideas and insights in a clear and concise manner, a valuable skill set for conveying complex information to diverse audiences.

### Real-World Projects
