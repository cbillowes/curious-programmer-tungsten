> (Ported from my old blog called _Thinky_)

I’ve been developing software since 2005. My primary focus has been on web solutions. For most of my career I’ve worked for smaller companies and I usually worked alone. In 2014, everything changed when I entered the corporate world. I had to:

- Learn a plethora of technologies
- Work in a large team
- Adapt to corporate processes
- Deal with a corporate proxy server

I have no regrets. I have learned so much that I felt the need to start documenting my findings.

## Understand the bigger picture

It is important to know the value in what you are doing. People forget that you don’t know what they know. Always ask why you are doing something.

- Determine the value
- Understand the audience
- Avoid waste by working as a team to “design” something
- Review the work before sending it for testing
- Keep your Test Analyst and Product Owner in the loop

Software development is more than just writing code. Developers need to collaborate with all team members. They need to brainstorm (and often knock heads) before production code can be written. There is nothing worse than a useless feature that could damage a brand.

## Origin of thinky

For a long time, I have wanted my own experimental website. I needed a domain :(.

I took to my whiteboard and started doodling. Eventually one stuck: the word think with a glowing light bulb above the i. I thought it was cool, especially for a developer. I then created an SVG of the logo.

I suppose I should have researched domain names before doodling. Obviously when I wanted to register it, think for every TLD was either in use or parked for $$$. As with most jQuery plugins, I just added a y to the end. Thus thinky was born.

## Its purpose

I want to use thinky as a knowledge base of my experiences and resources. I am hoping it will double as an encouragement mechanism for others to ask more questions instead of just going with the flow.

> TL;DR: Thinky is a play on the word think and why and that is the story you should tell.
