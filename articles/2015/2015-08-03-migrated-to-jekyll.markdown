> (Ported from my old blog called _Thinky_)

WordPress is a great platform to get a website up and running in no time. It offers great features as well as analytics. As a developer I felt frustrated as I needed to override a lot of things to get my page speed up. So I decided to migrate away from WordPress.

I chose [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a really cool static site generator built on Rails. Now I have everything in Git and am in full control with versioning.

I created thinky.co.za as an experimental brand to practice being Agile in a project of my own with the benefits of sharing my knowledge with others. Here is how things got rolling.

- I purchased a .co.za domain and simple Linux shared hosting plan via [MWEB](http://www.mweb.co.za/).
- Installed [WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) and configured [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/).
- Wrote some posts.
- Wanted a change so I investigated other blogging alternatives.

Things were a bit rushed in the beginning so after I spent a few hours playing around with Jekyll, I decided to get my [Product Owner](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/product-owner) hat on and get the migration going. I wanted my deployments to be iterative so I created stories for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). This was a lot easier because I got to decide what that was.

- Installed [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/download/)
- Created a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) website in [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- I created a backlog in [Trello](https://trello.com)
- Worked on a few of stories and deployed.

I think this is the most fun way to teach yourself a bunch of concepts. Find a project, make it yours and apply new techniques, technologies and methodologies so that you can learn more about them by applying them and making it visible to the world.
